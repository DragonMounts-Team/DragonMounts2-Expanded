# [Dragon Mounts 2](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dragon-mounts-2)
Dragon Mounts 2 is a sequel to Dragon Mounts, created by TheRPGAdventurer. A mod which adds over 15 new dragons to your game. In addition to new dragons, the mod adds in new armors and tools for players, Armors for Dragons, Nests that generates in every worlds, New Dragon breeds, and much more.
## Dragon Mounts 2: Continued
The continued support for this mod is now maintained by The Dragon Mounts Team and is endorsed by the original DM2 developers. Our goal is to bring back the original essence of Dragon Mounts, fixing many bugs it once had since it's last update (v1.6.3).

It is now completely dependency-free, and a lot of the codebase is cleaned up and most apparent bugs are fixed. This means you will no longer need LLibrary as a required dependency to run the mod, greatly enhancing compatibility with other mods.
## Licenses
The mods binaries, as well as its textures and code are licensed under the **GPLv3 license**.

Feel free to use the mod in any modpacks. You are allowed to use it, you do not need to ask for permission, in fact permission requests will usually be ignored. When using the mod, please use the Curse/Curseforge, Modrinth, or GitHub download and do not rehost the files.
